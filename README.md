This project offers a comprehensive framework for developing machine learning models to predict building energy consumption. It empowers you to build, train, and evaluate models that can help optimize energy usage in buildings.

## Key Features:

Modular Design: The project is organized into well-defined components for data ingestion, transformation, validation, evaluation, and model training. This promotes maintainability, reusability, and easier testing.
Data Handling: Ingestion: Load data from various sources, allowing flexibility in data collection methods.
Transformation: Clean, preprocess, and engineer features from your data to enhance model performance.
Validation: Ensure data quality by checking for missing values, outliers, and adherence to expected schema.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models suitable for energy prediction tasks.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
Prediction Pipeline: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data, enabling you to estimate future energy consumption.
Utilities: Leverage helper functions for common tasks like logging and exception handling.
Configuration Management: Potentially includes functionality for managing project-wide settings through constants or a configuration entity.
Benefits:

Improved Energy Efficiency: By accurately predicting energy usage, you can identify areas for optimization, leading to cost savings and a reduced environmental footprint.
Data-Driven Decision Making: The project allows you to analyze past energy consumption patterns and make informed decisions about building operations and upgrades.
Flexibility: Supports various data sources and model architectures, providing a customizable solution for different building types and needs.
